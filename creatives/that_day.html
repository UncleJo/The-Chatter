								<p>I was over the moon about the fact that I was getting into the college life. No doubt while I was looking forward to the opportunities that were knocking at my door, I  was a bit tensed too. </p>
								<p>As time got closer and closer for me to leave my home where I had been living since 18 years , the anxiety level kept increasing .My mind was flooded with various thoughts , whether I made the right decision ,will I be able to cope up with the environment and blah blah blah...</p>
                                <p>And finally the day came , 16th of July ,2018. It was around 23:00,the time to leave my hometown. I was getting dimmer and dimmer ,losing all my courage as I was going miles apart from my family . With the mixture of fear and excitement I finally boarded the train. Seeing my parents worried ,broke me a little. The whistle blew and the train left the station...</p>
                                <p>All over the way I kept thinking about my family and friends. As soon as I reached closer to my destination, the fear got replaced with excitement. No matter how excited I was about my college, leaving my home kept ripping me apart.</p>
                                <p>I came across several new faces in the college, had interactions with few of them.</p>
                                <p>Months passed!!</p>
                                <p>It’s funny how the faces that once seemed new and unknown are my family now. They are the ones who don’t let me miss my home . I got a new family here in just a time so little .</p>
                                <p>Little did I know I would be calling it the best phase of my life, from studies to all the various activities ,from games and fun to semester exams. I am gladly going to call it my right decision.</p>
                                <p>Even those no one can make me not miss or forget my family but these people here surely lessen the pain and grief. With them I m ready to face all the new challenges now and in future too. Let’s see what’s next planned for us!!</p>
